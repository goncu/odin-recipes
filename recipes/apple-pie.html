        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To make the pie crust, put the flour, sugar, salt, and butter into a food processor and blend until a breadcrumb consistency is reached. Add the egg yolk and whizz again for a moment, and finally the milk. Once the dough has formed, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and work until it is smooth. Wrap in cling wrap and chill for half an hour minimum before using.</li>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 200C/400F and place the pie tin in to heat up.</li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine all the filling ingredients except for the egg white and mix thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Dust your work surface with flour and roll out your pastry into a circle to fit your pie tin, leaving aside a small quantity of dough to make the top lattice. Fit the pastry to the tin, then spoon in the filling evenly. Sprinkle the top with brown sugar.</li>
            <li>Using a roller cutter or knife, cut out a lattice with the last of the dough and secure to the top of your pie. Brush all over with butter and the egg white to glaze.</li>
            <li>Bake for 30 minutes on the middle shelf. Leave to cool for 15 minutes before removing from the tin. Serve hot with a drizzle of custard or vanilla ice cream.</li>
        </ol>
